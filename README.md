## Would TODO

- CSS theming
- Add basic snapshot tests for pages; i.e. hitting Search renders images, clicking on image redirects to new route; test show page render, etc...
- Mock API calls with Jest
- Lazy load images, eg 20 by 20

## Note

You're on a `codekeepers` branch. Remain there to test this. The main branch is just a skeleton I use.
